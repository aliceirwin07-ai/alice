list 5 topics related to astronomy, physics, technology, science or math that sound interesting
to you.
- the unit circle
- primes
- modular arithmetic
- linear transformations
- inverses in Zn
2. For three of these topics, find a dataset, tool, news article, or paper online that relates to it.
Summarize how each source relates to the topic in your own words.
- fermats primality test, it's a way to use fermats little theorem to check if a number p is composite
- twin prime conjecture asks whether there are an infinite amount of n,n+2 pairs st both of them are prime
- inverses in Zn allow you to solve congruence problems such as with the Chinese remainder theorem or system of congruence equations
3. Choose one topic and brainstorm how you could Python skills (loops, conditionals, functions,
lists/dictionaries, github, version control) to explore, analyze or create something with it.
- fermats primality test, you could use a loop to compute whether a^p-1 is congruent to 1 mod p
- maybe create a list of composites so you can check what is and isn't prime 
- make a function that multiplies a 2 matrices together
- twin prime conjecture, you could just check and make a list of all the twin primes up to some number n with a for loop
- Chinese remainder theorem solver
4. Write down at least two possible project ideas connected to your topic. One should be
ambitious (a “dream” version) and the other should be smaller, simpler version that you
could realistically finish in a few weeks.
- multiply matrices and see how fast the function
- more realistically create a calculator to solve a system of congruence equations using the Chinese remainder theorem
